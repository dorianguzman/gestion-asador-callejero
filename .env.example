# Environment Variables for Gestion Asador Callejero

# Authentication Password
# This password protects access to the entire application via a custom login page
# Set this in Cloudflare Pages: Settings → Environment variables → Production
AUTH_PASSWORD=your-secure-password-here

# How it works:
# - Users will see a custom login page at /login.html
# - After entering the correct password, a secure session cookie is created
# - The session lasts 7 days and uses HMAC-SHA256 for security
# - Users can logout using the "Cerrar Sesión" button in the app

# Note: For local development with wrangler, create a .env file (not committed to git)
# and copy this variable with your actual password
